Aside from the PDF report, this folder includes the commented code associated with the project (kalmanSim.py) and a notebook file that explains the code and how it works (ENGR_E599_FinalProjectNotebook.ipynb). Feel free to take a look at either, thought the notebook file is more interpretable. Given that the simulation is stochastically generated, you can run the entire notebook file as many times as you want to see new results for each section of the project.
