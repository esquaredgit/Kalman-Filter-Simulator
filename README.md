# Kalman Filter Simulator

This repo contains the code and supporting documents I created for my final project in a graduate class on autonomous robotics. This program implemented the Kalman filtering algorithm over stochastically generated paths in order to improve my understanding of the method and to demonstrate its effectiveness. For more information on my motivation for this project and the details of its construction, read the project report included in this repo. 

## Description of Files:
Aside from the PDF report, this folder includes the commented code associated with the project (kalmanSim.py) and a notebook file that explains the code and how it works (ENGR_E599_FinalProjectNotebook.ipynb). Feel free to take a look at either, thought the notebook file is more interpretable. Given that the simulation is stochastically generated, you can run the entire notebook file as many times as you want to see new results for each section of the project.
